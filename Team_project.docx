Use case1 : (Basic use case)
software-based prototype of a CES device

Primary Actor: user
Goal in Context:The user wants to use the treatment service.
Scope: CES device
Level: SUMMAY
actors:
User: wants to use the treatment service
CES: Control function
Precondition: CES devices are running properly
Main Success Scenario and sub-steps:
1. User Connect power
2. User Placement of electrodes
(1) Oasis Pro checks the electrical connection, Blinking CES Mode light
(2) Until the connection is successful: CES Mode light disappear. [R] and [L] light on.
(3) Users wet their earlobes with a small amount of conductive gel and wear a black clip in their left ear and a red clip in their right ear
3. The user presses the power button
(1) The power light comes on, showing the battery level;
(2) If no treatment is selected within two minutes, power off
4. The user selects session in standard session groups(4) and sessions(8) which in session groups.
(1) When something can be selected, it is lit.
(2) the user can use the up and down buttons and the power button to select the session
(3) When the user presses the select button, the session is highlighted and the number flashes.
(4) Wait five seconds;
5. CES device: The treatment begins.
(1) User can adjust the intensity
6. CES device: The session ends and the current gradually decreases
Extensions :
3a. use case 2: Power
4a. use case 4: Save
4b.Use case5: recording
5a. use case 4: Ear-clamp Disconnection
5b.use case 2: Power
Use case2: Power
Primary Actor: CES
Scope: CES device
Level: Subfunctions
Other actor:
Graph：send warning
Precondition: The CES device works properly, and the user has pressed the power button.
Main Success Scenario:
1. CES device: Low power is detected
2. Graph：send warning
3. CES device: No starting session
1)If user are in a session now: stop in advance
 
Use case3: Ear-clamp Disconnection
 
Primary Actor: CES
Scope: CES device
Level: Subfunctions
Other actor: user:
Graph：send warning
Precondition: The CES device works properly, and the user has connect the Ear-clamp.
Main Success Scenario:
1. CES detects the ear-clamp disconnect
2. CES: The 7, 8 buttons flicker and the voltage drops to the safety range
3. Graph：send warning
4. Wait for reconnection
5. If the reconnection succeeds, continue the session
 
 
 
Use case4:Save button
 
Primary Actor: CES
Scope: CES device
Level: Subfunctions
Other actor: user
Precondition: The CES device works properly, and the user has select a session setting.
Main Success Scenario:
1. The user presses the Save button
2. CES records user Settings
3. This custom setting will default when the user re-enters the session group in the future
 
 
Use case5: recording
Primary Actor: CES
Scope: CES device
Level: Subfunctions
Other actor: user
Precondition: The CES device works properly, and the user has pressed the power button.
Main Success Scenario:
1. The user presses the [history] button
2. CES displays a history of previous sessions
(1) The user can select any record and start a session
